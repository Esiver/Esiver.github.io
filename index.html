                <p>
                    I am a highly skilled and versatile professional with a strong background in web development and a keen interest in technology and innovation. With a diverse skill set that includes JavaScript, TypeScript, C#, and expertise in CMS platforms like Umbraco and Shopify, I have contributed to the success of various projects and organizations. My ability to interpret UI designs and translate them into functional web solutions has been a valuable asset to the teams I have worked with.

                    My career journey has taken me from Aalborg, Denmark, to Shenzhen, China, where I have gained experience as a Web & Software Developer, specializing in eCommerce solutions, and as a Marketing Manager. These roles have honed my skills in JavaScript, React, and CMS platforms, making me adept at building and optimizing web experiences that drive business growth.
                    
                    In addition to my technical prowess, I possess excellent communication skills and a knack for problem-solving. I have a strong educational background, holding a Master's degree in China Studies from Zhejiang University and a Bachelor's degree in Robotics from Aalborg Universitet. My academic journey has equipped me with a deep understanding of policy-making, culture, and education, which I believe can complement my technical expertise in a variety of projects.
                    
                    Outside of my professional endeavors, I am passionate about fitness, languages, and the stock market, reflecting my commitment to personal growth and continuous learning. With fluency in Danish, English, and Chinese, I am well-equipped to work in diverse and global environments.
                    
                    In my spare time, I enjoy working on hobby projects, such as developing a Restaurant ERP system and creating an HTML RPG game engine. These projects showcase my dedication to innovation and my ability to take on complex challenges.
                    
                    I am also a co-author of a research paper titled "Using Collaborative Robots As A Tool For Easier Programming Of Industrial Robots," demonstrating my interest in robotics and industrial manufacturing.
                    
                    I am excited to bring my skills, experience, and passion for technology to new opportunities and collaborate with teams to drive success and innovation in the ever-evolving world of web development and technology.
